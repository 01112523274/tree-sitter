# Walking Trees with Tree Cursors

You can access every node in a syntax tree using the `TSNode` APIs [described above](#retrieving-nodes), but if you need to access a large number of nodes, the fastest way to do so is with a _tree cursor_. A cursor is a stateful object that allows you to walk a syntax tree with maximum efficiency.

Note that the given input node is considered the root of the cursor, and the
cursor cannot walk outside this node, so going to the parent or any sibling
of the root node will return `false`. This has no unexpected effects if the given
input node is the actual `root` node of the tree, but is something to keep in mind
when using nodes that are not the `root` node.

You can initialize a cursor from any node:

```c
TSTreeCursor ts_tree_cursor_new(TSNode);
```

You can move the cursor around the tree:

```c
bool ts_tree_cursor_goto_first_child(TSTreeCursor *);
bool ts_tree_cursor_goto_next_sibling(TSTreeCursor *);
bool ts_tree_cursor_goto_parent(TSTreeCursor *);
```

These methods return `true` if the cursor successfully moved and `false` if there was no node to move to.

You can always retrieve the cursor's current node, as well as the [field name](#node-field-names) that is associated with the current node.

```c
TSNode ts_tree_cursor_current_node(const TSTreeCursor *);
const char *ts_tree_cursor_current_field_name(const TSTreeCursor *);
TSFieldId ts_tree_cursor_current_field_id(const TSTreeCursor *);
```
